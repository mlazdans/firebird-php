# Firebird modern PHP extension

:warning: Development is still in progress, and the API is not yet stable.

This project aims to repackage the old [ibase](https://www.php.net/ibase)
extension into a more modern PHP framework. Internal resource types have been
removed and replaced with a object-oriented interface. Most of the ibase
extension features have now been ported; however, development is still in
progress, and the API is not yet stable.

Current development environment: PHP 8.4.4 NTS, Firebird 5.0.2, Debian 12 (64-bit).

Currently supported PHP versions: 8.4, 8.5, 8.6

# Some examples
```php
<?php declare(strict_types = 1);

$args = new \FireBird\Connect_Args;
$args->database = "localhost:/opt/db/test.fdb";
$args->user_name = "sysdba";
$args->password = "masterkey";

$db = \FireBird\Database::connect($args);
$t = $db->start_transaction();
$q = $t->query("SELECT * FROM TEST_TABLE");
while ($r = $q->fetch_object(\FireBird\FETCH_BLOB_TEXT)) {
    print_r($r);
}
```

Some example code can be fetched from [tests](tests/)

PHP stub file: [firebird.stub.php](firebird.stub.php)

# Build

## Linux
```
phpize
./configure --with-firebird
make
make install
```

Optionally specify Firebird 5.0 path: --with-firebird=/opt/firebird

## Windows

1. Install PHP SDK: https://github.com/microsoft/php-sdk-binary-tools
2. Install git, add to PATH
3. Copy build scripts from win32 to C:\php-sdk\
4. Adjust php-firebird-config.bat. PFB_SOURCE_DIR should point one level up, e.g. if you clone firebird-php into D:\firebird-php\firebird-php\, then PFB_SOURCE_DIR=D:\firebird-php\
```
cd C:\php-sdk\
php-firebird-build-all.bat
```

## General

- Collect opened and not closed statements/transactions/blobs/etc and report
- Test on Windows and different PHP versions.

## Statement

- isc_info_sql_get_plan, isc_info_sql_explain_plan and other information

## Explore IBatch posibilities

IStatement::createBatch, IAttachment::createBatch

- When inserting/updating large amounts of data.
- When reducing network round trips is critical.
- When handling bulk inserts with RETURNING values.
- When performing batch deletes/updates efficiently.

# Arrays

Is it worth even supporting array type? Firebird docs thinks not:
https://firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/html/en/refdocs/fblangref50/firebird-50-language-reference.html#fblangref50-datatypes-array

> Firebird does not offer much in the way of language or tools for working with the contents of arrays, and there are no plans to improve this. This limits the usefulness and accessibility of array types. Therefore, the general advice is: do not use arrays.

Arrays introduce unnecessary complexity. You can't even INSERT / UPDATE array fields using DSQL, just with isc API or PSQL. If arrays are needed these can be implemented using relation model.
